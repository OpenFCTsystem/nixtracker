  * In trying to keep the UI clean, would it be possible to add 
"arrows" or something like that to see previously heard stations, and WX 
stations?

  * Would it be possible that if I click on a previously heard station, 
it could re-render it in the top "heard station" so I can read it's 
beacon message, etc?

  *  In the previously heard stations, some callsigns show a timer since 
last heard but that creates quite a bit of client/server traffic.  I 
don't know if that's worth keeping.

  * In the GPS section of the UI, maybe it would be better to show a 
GPS satellite constellation icon (similar to xgps) instead of a classic 
cell bar icon

  * In the WX section, would it be possible to display the other 
received data like rain, etc?

  * beyond just Git pulls, are you planning on making some official 
releases in .tgz form, etc? [Debian Package]

  * In the 8081:spy.html view, would it be possible to show packets I send?

  * One thing I'd really like to see is that the APRS messages window 
be persistent across HTML reloads. Log messages to a file.

  * When displaying composed APRS message, display the destination address.

  * Show if that message was ACKed or how many retries are left on
this outgoing message to get an ACK?
 When sending messages, display a line when the ACK is received for a given 
message in the MSG window

  * Mapping support where locally cached OpenStreetMaps can be
displayed and icons placed on it.

  *  aprs uses obsolete (PF_INET,SOCK_PACKET) FIXED

  * msg tab is not rendered properly in FireFox
