===== Socket notes =====
  * aprsis (aprs-is.c) STREAM
  * display/ui socket
    either AF_INET or AF_UNIX
  * tnc socket 
    rx -> AF_INET SOCK_PACKET
    tx -> AF_AX25 SOCK_DGRAM (for aprs beacons & messages)

===== Config notes =====

A console packet spy (aprs-spy)  similar to listen is built as part of standard build.


===== gps notes =====

The aprs program now supports gpsd 10/4/2014

You need to config the serial/USB port used by gpsd in the .ini file.
This is the same serial port that would be used for the serial/usb
NMEA mode.

The 3 types of gps devices supported by the aprs program are:

static - fake, ie. no gps is installed
serial - for gps usb/serial devices using NMEA-0183 standard
gpsd - for the gpsd daemon using gps binary.

When running gpsd and the aprs program and you see this message
displayed:

"Clearing overrun buffer"

It probably means the aprs program is configured to use gps NMEA
sentences and the GPS device is outputting binary data.

NMEA sentences is the default GPS mouse mode. The serial interface
that is used to handle NMEA sentences uses a 32 byte buffer where as
socket interface used by gpsd outputs much more data than the size of
this buffer and over runs the NMEA parse buffer. gpsd defaults to
configuring the gps mouse in binary mode.

The GlobalSat BU-353-S4 I purchased from Radio Shack works well in
serial NMEA mode & NOT at all with gpsd in binary mode.

See this link for Gary Miller's recommendation ""DO NOT EVER BUY ONE"
http://www.catb.org/gpsd/hardware.html

Regardless of the recommendation this gps mouse is the best working
device I currently use in my truck when aprs is config'ed to use NMEA
sentences.

The gps mouse Byonics GPS2 purchased for the Tiny Trak 4 works well
with either the serial port in NMEA mode or gpsd in binary mode.
Switching this gps device between the 2 modes is problematic since
once gpsd is installed it restarts when ever the usb serial device is
unplugged/plugged into an USB hub.
